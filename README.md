Info
-------------

The [Blend4Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend4Web) framework leverages Blender to edit 3D scenes. Content rendering relies on WebGL, Web Audio and other web standards, without the use of plug-ins. A 3D scene can be prepared in Blender and then exported as a pair of JSON and binary files to load in a web application. The Blend4Web toolchain consists of JavaScript libraries, the Blender add-on and a set of tools for tweaking 3D scene parameters, debugging and optimization.

[Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_%28software%29) is a professional free and open-source 3D computer graphics software product used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, interactive 3D applications and video games. Blender's features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, camera tracking, rendering, video editing and compositing. You can download the latest version of Blender [here](https://www.blender.org/download/).
